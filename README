# 🧪 trial.py

This is a beginner repository where I experiment with different code, practice syntax, and build small functions or scripts.

## 📚 What’s inside

- Simple statements
- Input/output handling
- Basic control structures (if/else, loops, etc.)
- Just me getting comfortable with Python 🐍 and more

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is just for practice — trial and error — and will grow as I explore more!
