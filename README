# 🧪 trial.py

This is a beginner Python repository where I experiment with Python code, practice syntax, and build small functions or scripts.

## 📚 What’s inside

- Simple Python print statements
- Input/output handling
- Basic control structures (if/else, loops, etc.)
- Just me getting comfortable with Python 🐍

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is just for practice — trial and error — and will grow as I explore more of Python!

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
python trial.py
